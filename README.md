# Machine Learning Coursework Submission

## Files in the Zip Archive

1. **Machine Learning Coursework.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the machine learning tasks. It is recommended for code review due to its ability to provide a clearer presentation of the work.

2. **MLCW.py**: This Python script contains the same code as the Jupyter Notebook for the machine learning tasks. Both files produce identical results.

3. **wdbc.data**: This file is the dataset used for the analysis.

4. **Report.pdf**: The report summarizing the tasks, justifications, and analysis results.

## Code Organization

The code files (**Machine Learning Coursework.ipynb** and **MLCW.py**) are structured and include appropriate comments for ease of marking and running. Both **Machine Learning Coursework.ipynb** and **MLCW.py** contain the same code. If you can use jupyter notebook to check my code, I would recommend using ipynb code, it shows my work more clearly.
